# VR Science Fair

* VR Science Fair is a Google Cardboard VR research project for my Udacity VR Nanodegree. It explores different locomotion mechanics in a fun science fair environment.

## Requirements
* Unity 5.5.1
* Google VR (version is same as that in Puzzler)
* iTween
* Android Studio + JDK or XCode and all that provisioning jazz. (to build to device, if desired) 
* Google Cardboard (if building to device)

## Build Settings
* Add intro and main to Scenes in Build, intro as starting scene.

## Features
* Build and Run the project. When the intro scene is loaded onto your device, click "Let's Go" with your reticle to begin the experience. The school bell rings! Once in the gymanasium, click on each diamond to view its associated exhibit content. Click to start the video and audio and again to stop the playback. Additionally, trying clicking on the volcano to toggle the smoke and clicking on the potato battery for a secret message!
